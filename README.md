# copper_price_prediction_app

## **Introduction:**
The copper industry is facing difficulties in managing and analysing its sales and pricing data. The current methods of manual prediction are prone to errors and biases, which affect the accuracy and efficiency of the sales process. A machine learning solution is proposed to overcome these difficulties. The solution consists of two models: a regression model that predicts the selling price of copper based on various features, and a classification model that evaluates the lead quality based on the STATUS variable (WON or LOST). These models can help the copper industry improve its sales performance and perfect its pricing strategy.
